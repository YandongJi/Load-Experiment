# Load-Experiment
All Code used in Load Experiment report was uploaded here.
Run Case1_data_process.m first to get output array of each subject and then run Case1_fig_generate.m to get desired graphs.
Due to the file's extreme large size, original files are not uploaded on GitHub. Output files (dataset1.mat & dataset2.mat) were uploaded and can be used directly for figure generation. Load dataset1.mat or dataset2.mat first if you want to run Case1_fig_generate.m or Case2_fig_generate.m
